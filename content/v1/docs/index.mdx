# Introduction

**null docs** is a documentation template that gets out of your way. Write your docs in Markdown or MDX, configure everything from a single YAML file, and deploy anywhere that runs Bun.

## Why null docs?

- **Fast** — Bun runtime + ElysiaJS means sub-millisecond response times. Pages are server-rendered with zero client-side JavaScript by default.
- **Simple** — One `site.yaml` file controls your site name, theme, colors, fonts, navigation, and landing page layout.
- **MDX support** — Write standard Markdown with optional React components. Syntax highlighting is handled server-side with Shiki.
- **Built-in search** — FlexSearch indexes all your pages at build time. No external services required.
- **Type-safe** — All configuration is validated with Zod schemas. Errors are caught before they reach production.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nu11ified/docs-template my-docs
cd my-docs
bun install
bun run dev
```

Your docs site is running at `http://localhost:3000`.
